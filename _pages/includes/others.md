# ðŸ’¼ Work Experience
- OPUSCLIP Pte. Ltd. â€” Applied Scientist (2023.08â€“Present), Shanghai/Singapore
  - Led the end-to-end development of core AI products, from ideation to production.
  - Project: Reframe Anything â€” AI-Powered Video Reframing (AI Owner)
    - Developed and launched a flagship feature to automatically reframe horizontal (16:9) videos to vertical (9:16) by intelligently tracking subjects (faces, speakers, objects).
    - Architected a distributed, low-cost inference pipeline using TransNetV2, InsightFace, TalkNet, a custom-trained YOLOv8, and Gemini-Flash for complex scene understanding.
    - Impact: Drove a >100% increase in user "like" rates. A/B tests showed a 5.5% lift in overall video exports (7.2% for paid users) and a 2.4% reduction in churn, exceeding all OKR targets. Ranked #2 on Product Hunt.
  - Project: "Clip-Anything" â€” Multimodal Video Clipping (AI Owner)
    - Pioneered the market's first multimodal AI editing tool, enabling users to clip videos via visual, audio, and text-based prompts.
    - Innovated a novel "MM-screenplay" method to represent video as text, leveraging CAT-VD/AD and VMR models to overcome LLM context limitations. Our method won 1st place in a CVPR Workshop competition.
    - Impact: Created a key competitive advantage and a new growth driver for the company. Recognized by the Google Gemini team as a "best practice". Received mid-year "Exceeds Expectations" review and a company performance award.

- Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. â€” Algorithm Engineer (2022.08â€“2023.07), Shanghai
  - Developed a vision-based anti-swing control system for grab cranes using YOLOv5 and SURF for 3D position estimation, controlling motion via PID algorithms on PLC systems. Awarded the company's Independent Innovation Award.
  - Implemented a real-time safety system using YOLOv5 for personnel detection, integrating with PLC controls via C++/OPC to trigger automated stops. Recognized as a company-wide example of excellent hazard remediation.
  - Improved autonomous ship unloading efficiency by >10% through systematic debugging of LiDAR-based control systems.

- Ant Group Co., Ltd. â€” Research Intern (2021.06â€“2021.09), Shanghai/Hangzhou
  - Developed a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based multimodal fusion model to detect high-risk merchants by integrating heterogeneous data sources (e.g., transaction patterns, store profiles).
  - Received and accepted a full-time Special Offer after passing the conversion interview.

- Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence â€” Research Intern (2020.12â€“2021.05), Shanghai
  - Developed a non-contact patient positioning system for CT scanners using human pose estimation to identify body landmarks and automate scanner table movement.
  - Enhanced the CenterNet model for multi-task learning (2D detection, pose estimation, 3D localization), achieving >30 FPS on a single GPU and surpassing the original paper's performance.
